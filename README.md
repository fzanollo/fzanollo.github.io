# Hi, I'm Flopy. 

I'm a Computer Science's student with great interest in graph theory, algorithms, social network, open data and AI. I want to get better at automation and development; mostly web, games and apps. I like to see my work alive, being useful or entertaining for someone.

I worked as a teacher assistant at my University and really loved the job. It feels good to give back something and help the new generation in the same way many people helped me.

I also enjoy learning, new topics or ways to apply my current knowledge.
